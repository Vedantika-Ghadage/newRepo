Create and launch a Linux VM using OpenStack. Connect to the VM and
setup Nirmata agent by running the following command:

    sudo curl -sSL https://www.nirmata.io/nirmata-host-agent/setup-nirmata-agent.sh | sudo sh -s -- --cloud openstack

Now you can create a template for the VM using OpenStack Horizon. This
template should be selected when creating a host group for your
OpenStack provider.
