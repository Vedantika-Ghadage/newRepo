Known issue:

* When Prometheus is deployed in a cluster, the state displays as *Unknown* even when the add-on is running.

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) natively monitors kubernetes, nodes, and prometheus itself. The [Prometheus Operator](https://coreos.com/operators/prometheus/docs/latest/) simplifies Prometheus setup on Kubernetes, and allows you to serve custom metrics API using the Prometheus adapter. Prometheus provides a robust query language and a built-in dashboard for querying and visualizing your data. When deployed via Nirmata, Prometheus is supported by [Grafana](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/) for creating dashboard views of Prometheus data.

Kubernetes cluster monitoring via Prometheus tracks overall cluster CPU, memory, and/or file system usage in addition to individual pod, containers, and system services statistics using Custom Resource Definitions.

To add a Prometheus monitoring to a cluster, click *Add-ons* from within the cluster and then select *Add Prometheus*.

To deploy, an environment called nirmata-monitoring-[ClusterName] is created. The Prometheus operator [prometheus-operator] deploys inside the new environment and the Prometheus adaptor [prometheus] runs as a separate application within the environment.
To add Prometheus to an existing account, create a Prometheus add-on in the Nirmata Catalog and then deploy it in an Environment.
To test that Prometheus has deployed on the cluster, verify that Grafana is listed in Services.

Then, open the cluster and the Grafana service. Enter Grafana login credentials:

    User name: admin
    Password: admin

You will be immediately prompted to change your password.

Select *Add a data source* and choose *Prometheus*.

In the URL field, enter the port in which Prometheus is deployed. To locate the node port, retrieve the cluster services by entering Cluster Service Retrieval command in a command prompt.

**Cluster Service Retrieval Command:**

```
/ # kubectl get svc â€“n nirmata-monitoring
```

After entering the URL, click *Save & Test*.

Grafana will confirm that the *Datasource* is updated and *Data source is working*.

After deploying Grafana in the cluster, [create dashboard in Grafana](http://docs.grafana.org/guides/getting_started/) to monitor the cluster.

To view Prometheus metrics in Nirmata, select the cluster and then click on the analytics button.

Prometheus metrics displays in real-time.
