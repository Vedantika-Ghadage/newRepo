Applications deployed in Kubernetes can be fairly complex and are typically composed of several resources such as - Deployments, Statefulsets, ConfigMaps, Secrets, volumes etc. All of these resources need to be saved so that the application can be completely restored when needed.

Velero (previously known as ARK) is an open source tool that helps automate backup and restore of Kubernetes clusters, including any application and its data.

Velero, has become the de-facto number tool for Kubernetes backup and recovery. Velero is also an incubator project in CNCF and has a vibrant community. To learn more about features and use cases supported by Velero, check out the latest release documentation.

Velero enables the following use cases:

* Disaster recovery - backup of cluster and restore in case of a disaster.
* Application migration - migrate application along with its data from one cluster to another.
* Application cloning - replicating production environments for testing and debugging.

Also, Velero is fully integrated into the Nirmata Kubernetes management plane and available as add-on for every cluster in Nirmata, so that backups can be easily scheduled, and applications can be quickly recovered when needed. 

Nirmata supports Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The next section describes how to create an S3 Bucket on AWS.

## Create AWS Bucket
1. Log in to your AWS account.

2. Click on Amazon S3.

## Velero Configuration and Setup
Configure Velero by setting up and configuring a Backup Storage Location and setting up a Backup.

### Configure Backup and Storage Location

1. Click velero in the Add-on list.

2. Click Configure Backup and Snapshot Location in the Backup Storage Location section.

	<img src="/images/velero_add_backup_location.png" style="max-width:80%; height: auto;">

	The Add Backup Storage Location overlay appears.

	<img src="/images/velero_add_backup_location_overlay.png" style="max-width:100%; height: auto;">

3. Enter the Name of the Backup Storage and Location. 
4. Select another Region if you wish to change the default selection. 
5. Enter the name of the AWS S3 bucket created earlier in Bucket Name. 
6. Enter a Prefix for the directory that will store your backups. 

	For example, using `prod` as a prefix will place all namespace and cluster backups below the prod directory.

7. Click Add when completed or click Cancel to return to the previous page.

Nirmata displays the newly added Backup Storage and Volume Snapshot Location on the Add-ons page.

<img src="/images/velero_backup_location.png" style="max-width:80%; height: auto;">

You can verify the configuration is correct by reviewing the Backup storage location manifest. 

1. Click the name of the newly created Backup Storage Location under Name. The Storage Location Manifest overlay appears.

	<img src="/images/storage_location_manifest.png" style="max-width:80%; height: auto;">

2. Note the Status section and the `lastSyncedTime`. The presence of a status and timestamp indicates the backup location setup and configuration were completed successfully.

### Create Backup

1. To create backups for the cluster or a cluster namespace click Create Backups on the Backup/Restore Details page.

	<img src="/images/velero_add_backup.png" style="max-width:80%; height: auto;">
	
	The Add Backup overlay appears.
	
	<img src="/images/velero_add_backup_overlay.png" style="max-width:80%; height: auto;">
