If your cluster supports network policy, you can configure them as part
of your application. A network policy specifies how groups of pods are
allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints.

Network Policies use labels to select pods and define rules which
specify what traffic is allowed to the selected pods. By default, all
pods in a Namespace can communicate with each other.

See [Network Policies](https://docs.nirmata.io/policies/network_policies/) for more information.
