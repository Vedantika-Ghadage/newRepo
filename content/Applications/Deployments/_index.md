You can use Deployment for stateless services in your application. As
part of your Deployment you can define a Pod template with one or more
containers. For each container, you can add settings such as image
information, run command, health checks, environment variables, volume
mounts, container ports etc.

To enable communication with other components in your application, or
with external clients, you can expose one or more ports of your
containers by defining a Service.
