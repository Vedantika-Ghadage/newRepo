Nirmata is designed using cloud-native principles and architected as a set of containerized microservices. Nirmata is available in the following deployment models:

 -   **Nirmata SaaS**: a highly-secure and scalable multi-tenant cloud service operated and managed by the Nirmata team
 -   **Nirmata Private Edition (Nirmata PE)**: a private copy of the Nirmata solution that runs in your (i.e. the customer's) private cloud or data center and is managed by your operations team.

This section provides documentation on the Nirmata Private Editon:
