You can connect any virtual or physical server to Nirmata using the
'Direct Connect' cloud provider type. With this type of deployment you
control which servers are made available in a Host Group. Auto scaling
and recovery of hosts is not supported for this host type.

A Direct Connect cloud provider is already created in each account. You
can create Direct Connect Host Groups without any additional setup.

**Next Steps**: Setup a [`direct-connect-host-group`](/hostgroups/#direct-connect-host-group) Host Group.
