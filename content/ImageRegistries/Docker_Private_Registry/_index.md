To securely connect Nirmata with a Docker Registry in your Private Cloud
of Data Center, first setup a [`private-cloud-setup`](/cloudproviders/#private-cloud-setup).

A private registry can be added by specifying the registry URL and the
credentials (optional). Once the registry is added, users can view the
image repositories in that registry as well as the list of tags for each
image repository. Users can also create a new service for an image, view
details of a tag or compare two tags.
